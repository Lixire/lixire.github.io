<h3 id="key-concepts-in-economics">Key Concepts in Economics</h3>

<ul>
<li>define economics and distinguish between <em>microeconomics</em> and <em>macroeconomics</em></li>
<li>Explain the two <em>big questions</em> of economics</li>
<li>Explain the key ideas that define the <em>economic way of thinking</em></li>
<li>Explain how economists go about their business</li>
</ul>

<p>All economic questions arise because <strong>we want more than we can get</strong> <br>
+ what does that mean? <br>
+ Example: Time</p>

<p>Our inability to satisfy all our wants is called <strong>scarcity</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Economics is the social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influence and reconcile those choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Economics divides in to main parts: <br>
    + Microeconomics (micro- small) <br>
    + Macroeconomics (macro- large)</p>

<p><strong>Two big questions</strong> summarize the scope of economics: <br>
     + How do choices end up determining <strong>what</strong>, <strong>how</strong> and <strong>for whom</strong> goods and services get produced? <br>
    + When do choices made in the pursuits of <strong>self-interest</strong> also promote the <strong>social interest</strong>?</p>

<p>What, How, and For Whom?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>goods and services are the objects that people value and produce to satisfy human wants</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="what">What</h4>

<p>What is being produced <br>
+ Influenced by choices that people made in the past <br>
+ Why did people in China make different choices than people in Canada?</p>



<h4 id="how">How</h4>

<p>Goods and services are produced by using productive resources that economists call factors of production <br>
Factors of production are grouped into four categories: <br>
+ Land <br>
+ Labour <br>
+ Capital <br>
+ Entrepreneurship</p>



<h4 id="for-whom">For Whom</h4>

<p>Who gets the goods and services depends on the incomes that people earn <br>
+ Land earns <strong>rent</strong> <br>
+ Labour earns <strong>wages</strong> <br>
+ Capital earns <strong>interest</strong> <br>
+ Entrepreneurship earns <strong>profit</strong></p></body>
